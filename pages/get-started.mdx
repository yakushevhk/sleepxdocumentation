## Whats is Web3?

![Web3](https://sleepx.hb.bizmrg.com/img/web3.png)

There are a few fundamental differences between web2 and web3, but decentralization is at its core.

Web3 enhances the internet as we know it today with a few other added characteristics. web3 is:

* Verifiable
* Trustless
* Self-governing
* Permissionless
* Distributed and robust
* Stateful
* Native built-in payments

In web3, developers don't usually build and deploy applications that run on a single server or that store their data in a single database (usually hosted on and managed by a single cloud provider).

Instead, web3 applications either run on blockchains, decentralized networks of many peer to peer nodes (servers), or a combination of the two that forms a cryptoeconomic protocol. These apps are often referred to as dapps (decentralized apps), and you will see that term used often in the web3 space.

To achieve a stable and secure decentralized network, network participants (developers) are incentivized and compete to provide the highest quality services to anyone using the service.

When you hear about web3, you'll notice that cryptocurrency is often part of the conversation. This is because cryptocurrency plays a big role in many of these protocols. It provides a financial incentive (tokens) for anyone who wants to participate in creating, governing, contributing to, or improving one of the projects themselves.

These protocols may often offer a variety of different services like compute, storage, bandwidth, identity, hosting, and other web services commonly provided by cloud providers in the past.

People can make a living by participating in the protocol in various ways, in both technical and non-technical levels.

Consumers of the service usually pay to use the protocol, similarly to how they would pay a cloud provider like AWS today. Except in web3, the money goes directly to the network participants.

**Native payments**

Tokens also introduce a native payment layer that is completely borderless and frictionless. Companies like Stripe and Paypal have created billions of dollars of value in enabling electronic payments.

These systems are overly complex and still do not enable true international interoperability between participants. They also require you to hand over your sensitive information and personal data in order to use them.

Crypto wallets like MetaMask and Torus enable you to integrate easy, anonymous, and secure international payments and transactions into web3 applications.

## What is Polygon?

![Polygon Icon](https://sleepx.hb.bizmrg.com/img/polygonicon.png)

[Polygon.Technology](https://polygon.technology)

Polygon is a ‚Äúlayer two‚Äù or ‚Äúsidechain‚Äù scaling solution that runs alongside the Ethereum blockchain ‚Äî allowing for speedy transactions and low fees. MATIC is the network‚Äôs native cryptocurrency, which is used for fees, staking, and more. 

Enter Polygon, which is a ‚ÄúLayer 2‚Äù scaling solution (or ‚Äúsidechain‚Äù) that‚Äôs emerged to provide faster transactions and lower costs for users. It acts as a speedy parallel blockchain running alongside the main Ethereum blockchain. To use it, you can ‚Äúbridge‚Äù some of your crypto over to Polygon, and then interact with a wide range of popular crypto apps that were once exclusive to the main Ethereum blockchain. 

**What is MATIC?**

Polygon has its own cryptocurrency, called MATIC, which is used to pay fees on the Polygon network, for staking, and for governance (which means that MATIC holders get to vote on changes to Polygon). 

**How does Polygon work?**

You can picture Polygon as being like an express train on a subway ‚Äî it travels along the same route as the regular train, but it makes fewer stops and thus moves much faster. (In this analogy the main Ethereum blockchain is the local train.) Polygon uses a variety of technologies to create this speedy parallel blockchain and link it to the main Ethereum blockchain. 

To create new MATIC and secure the network, Polygon uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism ‚Äî which means that one way you earn money on MATIC you hold is via staking.
