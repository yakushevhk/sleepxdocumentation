According to some reports, **about 30% of people** suffer from lack of sleep. Healthy sleep is the key to success in work, productivity and good mood ðŸ”‘

We believe that we can change the situation in the world in the game. You not only earn money, but also control your sleep. ðŸ’­

*As the sun sets each day and it gets dark outside, you should ideally be winding down to go to sleep. But bingeing that TV show or scrolling through social media keeps you up past midnight instead of hitting the hay at a decent hour.*

*A recent study suggests that going to sleep at 10 p.m. is the optimal time.*





****How many hours of sleep should you get?****

*Itâ€™s recommended that adults get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night. But Dr. Lance suggests finding the total amount of sleep that works for you. So, 7-1/2 hours might work for you while your partner may need 9 hours.*

*In an ideal night, one would cycle through the various stages of sleep five to six times. Each cycle contains four individual stages: three that form non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and one rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.*






## Sleep tips

**If youâ€™re having trouble going to sleep at the same time every night**

**Aim to eat dinner at the same time every night.**Â Picking a time and then trying to stick with it can help reset your sleep-wake cycle. And avoid eating any snacks two hours before bed.

**Take a small dose of melatonin.** Use instant-release supplements as opposed to one thatâ€™s extended release, which dissolves slowly.

**Eliminate naps.**Â This doesnâ€™t mean naps are bad, but if youâ€™re having trouble falling asleep at night, then this might be the culprit.

**Minimize alcohol or caffeine in the evening.**Â Contrary to popular belief, alcohol doesnâ€™t help you fall asleep. It may at first, but then itâ€™ll disrupt your sleep later in the night.
