According to some reports, **about 30% of people** suffer from lack of sleep. Healthy sleep is the key to success in work, productivity and good mood ðŸ”‘

We believe that we can change the situation in the world in the game. You not only earn money, but also control your sleep. ðŸ’­

*As the sun sets each day and it gets dark outside, you should ideally be winding down to go to sleep. But bingeing that TV show or scrolling through social media keeps you up past midnight instead of hitting the hay at a decent hour.*

*A recent study suggests that going to sleep at 10 p.m. is the optimal time.*





****How many hours of sleep should you get?****

*Itâ€™s recommended that adults get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night. But Dr. Lance suggests finding the total amount of sleep that works for you. So, 7-1/2 hours might work for you while your partner may need 9 hours.*

*In an ideal night, one would cycle through the various stages of sleep five to six times. Each cycle contains four individual stages: three that form non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and one rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.*






## Sleep Tips

**If youâ€™re having trouble going to sleep at the same time every night**

**Aim to eat dinner at the same time every night.**Â Picking a time and then trying to stick with it can help reset your sleep-wake cycle. And avoid eating any snacks two hours before bed.

**Take a small dose of melatonin.** Use instant-release supplements as opposed to one thatâ€™s extended release, which dissolves slowly.

**Eliminate naps.**Â This doesnâ€™t mean naps are bad, but if youâ€™re having trouble falling asleep at night, then this might be the culprit.

**Minimize alcohol or caffeine in the evening.**Â Contrary to popular belief, alcohol doesnâ€™t help you fall asleep. It may at first, but then itâ€™ll disrupt your sleep later in the night.

## Sleep Stages

**Newborns & infants (birth-1 year)**

Sleep timing in newborns is distributed evenly across day and night for the first few weeks of life, with no regular rhythm or concentration of sleeping and waking. Newborns sleep approximately 16-18 hours per day discontinuously, with the longest continuous sleep episode typically lasting 2.5 to 4 hours. Newborns have three different types of sleep: quiet sleep (similar to NREM), active sleep (similar to REM), and indeterminate sleep. In contrast to children and adults, newborn sleep onset occurs through REM, not NREM, with each sleep episode consisting of only one or two cycles. These differences in sleep and sleep stages occur as circadian rhythms have not fully been determined.

Circadian rhythms begin to develop around two to three months of age, with greater durations of waking hours during the day and longer periods of sleep at night. At two months of age, the progression of nocturnal sleeping begins. Three months of age is when the cycling of melatonin and cortisol in a circadian rhythm occurs and when sleep onset begins with NREM. At this time, REM sleep decreases and shifts to the later part of the sleep cycle. The total NREM and REM sleep cycle is typically 50 minutes instead of the adult 90-minute cycle. At six months of age, the longest continuous sleep episode lengthens to six hours. At 12 months of age, infants typically sleep 14-15 hours per day, with most sleep now occurring in the evening with only one to two naps needed during the day.

**Toddlers (age 1 to 3) and children (age 3 to 9)**

Around the ages of two to five, the total sleep time needed each day decreases by two hours, from 13 to 11 hours. By six years old, children will manifest circadian sleep phase preferences and tend toward being a night owl or an early riser. One study found that children appear to have longer REM sleep latencies than adolescents and thus spend more time in stage N3.

**Adolescents (age 10 to 18)**

The total sleep time required for adolescents is 9-10 hours each night. Due to various pubertal and hormonal changes that accompany the onset of puberty, slow-wave-sleep and sleep latency time declines, and time in stage N2 increases. Around mid puberty, greater daytime sleepiness occurs than is seen at earlier stages of puberty.

**Adults (age 18+)**

Adults tend to demonstrate earlier sleep time, wake time, and reduced sleep consolidation. Older adults (65+) have been shown to awaken approximately 1.5 hours earlier and sleep one hour earlier than younger adults (20 to 30).

**Gender Differences**

Men tend to spend a greater time in stage N1 sleep and experience more nighttime awakenings, causing them to be more likely to complain of daytime sleepiness. Women maintain slow-wave sleep longer than men and tend to complain more often of difficulty falling asleep. Additionally, daytime sleepiness increases during pregnancy and the first few months postpartum.

**N1 (Stage 1) - Light Sleep (5%)**

EEG recording: theta waves - low voltage

This is the lightest stage of sleep and begins when more than 50% of the alpha waves are replaced with low-amplitude mixed-frequency (LAMF) activity. Muscle tone is present in the skeletal muscle, and breathing tends to occur at a regular rate. This stage lasts around 1 to 5 minutes, consisting of 5% of total sleep time.

**N2 (Stage 2) - Deeper Sleep (45%)**

EEG recording: sleep spindles and K complexes

This stage represents deeper sleep as your heart rate and body temperate drop. It is characterized by the presence of sleep spindles, K-complexes, or both. Sleep spindles are brief, powerful bursts of neuronal firing in the superior temporal gyri, anterior cingulate, insular cortices, and thalamus, inducing calcium influx into cortical pyramidal cells. This mechanism is believed to be integral to synaptic plasticity. Numerous studies suggest that sleep spindles play an important role in memory consolidation, specifically procedural and declarative memory.

K-complexes are long delta waves that last for approximately one second and are known to be the longest and most distinct of all brain waves. K-complexes have been shown to function in maintaining sleep and memory consolidation.[18] Stage 2 sleep lasts around 25 minutes in the first cycle and lengthens with each successive cycle, eventually consisting of about 45% of total sleep. This stage of sleep is when bruxism (teeth grinding) occurs.

**N3 (Stage 3) - Deepest Non-REM Sleep (25%)**

EEG recording: delta waves - lowest frequency, highest amplitude

N3 is also known as slow-wave sleep (SWS). This is considered the deepest stage of sleep and is characterized by signals with much lower frequencies and higher amplitudes, known as delta waves. This stage is the most difficult to awaken from, and, for some people, even loud noises (> 100 decibels) will not awaken them. As people age, they tend to spend less time in this slow, delta wave sleep and more time in stage N2 sleep. Although this stage has the greatest arousal threshold, if someone is awoken during this stage, they will have a transient phase of mental fogginess, known as sleep inertia. Cognitive testing shows that individuals awakened during this stage tend to have moderately impaired mental performance for 30 minutes to an hour. This is the stage when the body repairs and regrows tissues, builds bone and muscle and strengthens the immune system. This is also the stage when sleepwalking, night terrors, and bedwetting occurs.

**REM (25%)**

EEG recording: beta waves - similar to brain waves during wakefulness

REM is associated with dreaming and is not considered a restful sleep stage. While the EEG is similar to an awake individual, the skeletal muscles are atonic and without movement, except for the eyes and diaphragmatic breathing muscles, which remain active. However, the breathing rate becomes more erratic and irregular. This stage usually starts 90 minutes after you fall asleep, with each of your REM cycles getting longer throughout the night. The first period typically lasts 10 minutes, with the final one lasting up to an hour. REM is when dreaming, nightmares, and penile/clitoral tumescence occur.  

***Important characteristics of REM:***

* Associated with dreaming and irregular muscle movements as well as rapid movements of the eyes
* A person is more difficult to arouse by sensory stimuli than during SWS
* People tend to awaken spontaneously in the morning during an episode of REM sleep
* Loss of motor tone, increased brain O2 use, increased and variable pulse and blood pressure
* Increased levels of ACh
* The brain is highly active throughout REM sleep, increasing brain metabolism by up to 20%

## Deprivation Symptoms

The term sleep deprivation refers to getting less than the needed amount of sleep, which, for adults, ranges from seven to nine of sleep per night. Children and teens need even more nightly sleep than adults.

The primary signs and symptoms of sleep deprivation include excessive daytime sleepiness and daytime impairment such as reduced concentration, slower thinking, and mood changes.

Feeling extremely tired during the day is one of the hallmark signs of sleep deprivation. People with excessive daytime sleepiness may feel drowsy and have a hard time staying awake even when they need to. In some cases, this results in microsleeps in which a person dozes off for a matter of seconds.

Insufficient sleep can directly affect how a person feels during their waking hours. Examples of these symptoms include:

* Slowed thinking
* Reduced attention span
* Worsened memory
* Poor or risky decision-making
* Lack of energy
